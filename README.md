# Missing values are informative in label-free shotgun proteomics data

The relationship between missingness and intensity is evaluated in label-free
shotgun proteomics data. Using a series of publicly available datasets, we first 
empirically investigate the missingness-intensity relationship with observed 
data. We also propose a model for detection probability which describes
the probability of an observation being detected given its underlying intensity
for label-free shotgun proteomics data.
