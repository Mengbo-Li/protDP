\title{Dataset A: Hybrid proteome data}
\format{
List of data matrices of precursor- and protein-level intensities.
}
\usage{
datasetA
}
\description{
Hybrid proteome samples were generated by mixing human, yeast and E.coli
lysates in different ratios and analysed by SWATH-MS. The dataset of
interest was obtained from TripleTOF6600 with the 64-variable-window
acquisition. The dataset was processed by DIA-NN under the library-based
mode. Only triplicates of Sample A are included here.
