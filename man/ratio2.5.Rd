\title{Supplementary Dataset : UPS1 spiked in yeast extract}
\format{
List of data matrices of precursor- and protein-level intensities.

\usage{
ratio2.5

\description{
Three concentrations of UPS1 (25 fmol, 10 fmol and 5 fmol) were spiked in
yeast extract. This is a DDA dataset processed by MaxQuant. Here we use the
dataset which compares 25 fmol to 10 fmol spiked-ins.
